## Unit testing
There are number of different ways to run your unit tests, e.g.:
* In test class put your cursor on its definition, right click and choose `Run ...`
* Right click on a little green triangle near the class definition and choose `Run ...`
* In test class put your cursor on its definition and press `Ctrl+Shift+F10`
* Once you executed your test you could re-run it again by pressing `Shift+F10`
